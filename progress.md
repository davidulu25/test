1. ### python dunder methods
    Dunder refers to double underscore, and python dunder methods are methods that have two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name.
    dunder can be used for operator overloading where functions are defined to improve the context of what basic python operators can do.
    Typically, dunder methods are not directly invoked by the user, making it look like the functions are called by magic. It is why dunder methods are also sometimes referred to as 'magic methods'

    ### Why do dunder methods start and end with two underscores?
    The short answer is name collision. dunder methods are conventionally named like that to prevent unsuspecting programmers from having to deal with errors in their code when naming customised functions

    All python operators like '+', '==' and 'in' rely on dunder to implement their behaviour

## Day 6
    packages allow for a hierarchical structure of module name
    packages help avoid collisiion between module names

    #implicit namespace packages#

    __all__ can also be defined in modules aside from the init.py file
